          Hi, I’m Ritika Suman. I’m a fresher in the field of web development, currently learning and applying my skills through hands-on projects.
          I enjoy working on the front end and have been gradually building my understanding of how websites work—from layout and styling to basic interactivity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
          I’m also comfortable using Linux, which helps me manage my workflow and understand development environments better.
          While I’m still learning, I try to approach each project as a chance to improve and explore new ideas. My goal is to keep building,
          keep experimenting, and eventually contribute to meaningful and unique solutions as I grow in this field.
        </p>
      </div>
